# AnnotationsInKotlin
This project demonstrates how to create annotations in Kotlin with custom implementations. It also features a validation annotation that uses the Rule Engine Design Pattern.

The validation annotation has multiple implementations, each of which handles a different type of validation. The utility class decides which validation to perform based on the annotation that is used.
